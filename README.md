The story of Tristan Bercovitch
By: Miles, Matthew, and Aiden
Intro:
Once upon a time, Tristan Bercovitch found an eyeball floating in his spaghetti. Most people believe he simply swallowed it by accident. But that’s not the truth.
Tristan’s life had already been a quiet horror story. His father, hollowed out by years of drinking, spent every night drowning in bottles and every morning he took his rage out on Tristan. Food was scarce, kindness was even scarcer. On one fateful winter evening, weak from hunger, Tristan stumbled into the sewers in search of rats to eat anything to silence the pain clawing at his stomach.
That’s where he met the Starer.
The demon loomed from the shadows, its gaze seemingly burning a hole into Tristan's heart. “Take my eyeball,” it said, voice echoing like a sheer scream. “Digest it and my power becomes yours. You will never be hungry again.”
Desperation dulled Tristan’s fear. He took the gift, trembling, and swallowed the eye whole.
From then on, Tristan Bercovitch would fall into periodic episodes where he blacks out and transforms into something far more sinister. 
Chapter One:
On the 25th of October Tristan passed out once more, but this time was different. He remembered everything. 10,000 women who were all killed by his hands. He couldn't believe it.
From then on Tristan could only stare in silence at the women who he could kill at any moment, not daring to close his eyes for even a second, to keep the beast within. For if he closes his eyes at all, the starer within will emerge from the shadowy depths of Tristan's heart to kill again. He had become the San Francisco Starer.
